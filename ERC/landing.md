					<h3>Trotbot</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Team Lead: Harshal Deshpande <br>
						Trotbot is a multipurpose robot, designed to serve autonomously in indoor environment. It can be used as follows:
						To deliver packages from one location to another in offices, construction sites,etc
						Can be teleoperated to nearby locations using the camera feed
						The robot will be able to autonomously navigate around obstacles and reach waypoints set in and around the environment with the use of onboard sensors and be able to detect it's location.
						Currently, we are looking at visual odometry as an alternative for mouse for localisation of the robot.	</p>

					<h3>Quadruped</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Team Lead: Mohit Gupta<br>
				The main objective is to mimic a four legged animal and get various gaits out of it like trot, bound, canter through open loop and closed loop methods. It will be further used as a platform for attachment of vision based system for mapping different terrains
				We have successfully deployed trotting walk on the quadruped. A ROS(Robot Operating System) package is also created. A static self-stabilizing PID controller using an IMU has been created and successfully deployed on the quadruped.
				Different gaits will be tested on the quadruped. A dynamic stabilizing strategy will be developed. Later, environment tracking using realsense depth camera will be developed.

					<h3>Modbot</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Team Lead: Prathmesh Thorwe <br>
				Modular Robots are a system of individual modules capable of linking to each other to form reconfigurable structures suited for different purposes. This is useful when the task/environment of a bot is not known beforehand.
				The project aims to design, simulate and manufacture such modules with maximum DOFs possible for a highly flexible and robust system.

					<h3>LED Globe</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Team Lead: Mohit Gupta <br>
				LED Globe was the flagship display project from ERC for Quark 2019, the technical fest of BITS-Goa.
				The globe consisted of 2, 75 cm radius acrylic semicircular discs having LEDs along the perimeter of one of them. This setup was mounted vertically on a aluminium frame. The setup would be rotated using a high torque motor. The synchronised firing of LEDs created the illusion of an image.The programming that was involved allowed one to take any any image from the internet, divide it into a number of segments which the code could recognize and thus program the LEDs in that manner.
